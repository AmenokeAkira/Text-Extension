# \<Text Extension\>
To open a file with the .median extension, you need to obtain either its name or its path. The text extension is required in cases where a complete decoding of files has occurred due to an update of the development environment, or in more general cases when you need to view the contents of the file without executing it.

For a specific case, let's consider a file located at the path 'C:\Users\admin\Documents\GitHub\Median_Extensions'. This file is in the extensions directory itself. After copying the path, we launch a text extension with the cpp type.

We are presented with a standard console (Windows/Linux/MacOS) and the message **"Enter the name of the text file with the .median extension (or specify its path): "**. You need to enter the copied path or the name of the file (with the extension) after the colon.
After entering, the full content of the file appears before us.
