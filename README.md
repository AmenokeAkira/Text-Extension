# \<Text Extension\>
The text extension for the Median development environment is a revolutionary tool that significantly simplifies the process of creating text files and programs without the need for deep knowledge of the Median+ programming language. Initially added to the console version of the terminal, it was developed by Amenoke Akira and has since established itself as a valuable assistant for developers of all levels.

One of the key features of the extension is its high speed and simplicity in writing text files. Users can create text programs without needing to understand the complex syntax of the language, making it accessible to beginners and those without programming experience. The web version, launched on March 27, 2025, allows users to work through a browser, ensuring access from anywhere.

Overall, the text extension for Median is a tool that not only increases productivity but also makes programming more accessible to a wider audience.
